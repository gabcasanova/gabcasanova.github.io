EduSyst consists of three interconnected applications, each tailored to different user needs and powered by a centralized MySQL database. <br/><br/> - The <strong> EduSyst Desktop App</strong>, built with Java SE, Swing, and the JDBC API, is designed for school administrators. It handles student and teacher registrations, course management, scheduling, and report generation, ensuring smooth institutional operations. <br/> - The <strong>EduSyst Web App</strong>, developed using Java Server Pages (JSP), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, serves students, teachers, and parents. Teachers can manage grades, transcripts, and student assessments while also communicating with students through a class chat system. Parents and students can access class schedules, assignments, and teacher information. <br/> - The <strong>EduSyst Mobile App</strong>, built with Android Studio (Java) and PHP for MySQL connectivity, offers a native mobile experience. It provides students, teachers, and parents with the same essential functionalities as the web app, ensuring accessibility on the go. <br/><br/> EduSyst was a challenge that pushed me to apply everything I had learned, from databases to fullstack development. Seeing it come together reinforced my passion for building software that solves real problems.",
